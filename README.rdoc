Install Ruby V2.1.1

Git clone this app into new directory

'Bundle install' to get all gems installed

I am using Sequel Pro for all my database needs

'rake db:create' to get database created

'rake db:migrate' to get database migrated with all the neccessary tables and columns

'rake db:seed' to prepopulate your DB with some data

Start rails server

Direct your browser to localhost:3000 (or which ever port you assign your rails server to)

Have Fun!
